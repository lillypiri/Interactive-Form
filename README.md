#### Project 3 📒🎓

## Interactive Form

###### This is the third of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

I've aimed for Exceeds Expectations by expanding the project as follows:

- “Color” drop down menu is hidden until a T-Shirt design is selected.
- The name and email fields change depending on the error.
- Name, Email, and Credit Card info fields display errors in real time.
- Tested on Chrome (Version 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit)), Firefox (54.0.1 (64-bit), & Safari (Version 10.1.2 (12603.3.8)).
